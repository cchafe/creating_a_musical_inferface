Creating A Musical Streaming Interface
Free JackTrip course offered by Newline - Hawi Abraham
This will be a free course, offered by Newline, on the basics of JackTrip and how to create your own musical streaming interface similar to JackTrip from scratch. For the uninitiated, JackTrip is a musical interface that allows musicians to collaborate remotely. Proper use of JackTrip lets musicians work without being bounded by their physical location.

Students of this course will use C++ to create their own simple musical interface. The musical interface will be capable of sending and receiving audio, connecting to a server with the lowest possible latency, and building out a graphical user interface to manage connections and audio (such as adjusting volume or muting).

Our likely target audience is developers who are excited about music streaming technology but unsure of where to get started. Students may be newly familiar with coding but donâ€™t know how to apply their skills. Our secondary audience are students, musicians, and music enthusiasts.
